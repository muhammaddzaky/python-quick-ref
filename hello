This is a short cheat sheet for python 3.1. I wanted a quick reference for the core language that was short (2 pages tops) and beautiful and free. I found some but not quite what I was looking for, so I made this one using LaTeX. You can compile it from source or you can download it here:

Thanks
Sarabander made some adjustments in typesetting and color, used a vector graphics for the Python logo and fixed the URL.
